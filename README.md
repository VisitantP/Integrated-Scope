# Integrated-Scope
Integrated scope is a measuring Instrument just like a Digital Storage Oscilloscope with certain additional improvements. The word "Integrated" is coined since this Instrument is capable of measuring and analyzing multiple physical quantities such as temperature, current, pressure, etc and this forms one of the outlining feature of this device in contrast to Digital oscilloscope. The prototype developed is capable of performing almost all of the functions of a conventional Digital Storage Oscilloscope and can measure upto three physical quantities -voltage, current and temperature.
